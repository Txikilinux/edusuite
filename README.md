This is a videogame designed for children to play educational games.

In all games there must be difficulty levels.

For example:

- Find an object. We use IA generated scenes so that players must point the object described with some clues. For example: (1) It is an animal. (2) It barks. (3) It is brown. (We point the dog).
  Or thegame writes "dog", and we must find and point it.

- We play with colors. We have the three basic colors and the game shows us the result, we have to mix colors to fit the result.
  Also, we have the three basic light colors, we mix them so that we get the proper color.
