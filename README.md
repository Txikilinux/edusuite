This is a videogame designed for children to play educational games.

In all games there must be difficulty levels.

For example:

- Find an object. We use IA generated scenes so that players must point the object described with some clues. For example: (1) It is an animal. (2) It barks. (3) It is brown. (We point the dog).
  Or we write "dog", and we must find and point it.
